  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <div id="video">
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iyui1ChvvD8?rel=0&modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&theme=light" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <h3>Download and Install the chrome extension</h3>
  <p>All the code is open source and avaialable on GitHub to <a href="https://github.com/uberify/uberify/">download</a>. To install it, open chrome on the extension settings page by going to <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> and follow the installation procedure there.</p>

  <h3>Connect with your Uber account</h3>
  <p>Once enabled you can just click on the icon on the toolbar, and login with your Uber account. On success the Uber icon will glow, meaning you are now good to go. You will see your profile info now if you click on the icon again, and you will be able to logout if needed.</p>

  <h3>Navigate the web</h3>
  <p>Just start browsing, and every address found will be uberified in a button that will call Uber for you for that address. As a pickup point Uberify uses the HTML5 geolocation API. Scroll down this page and if uberify installed successfully you should see a 'Call Uber' button appear.</p>

  <h3>When needed, just choose your ride</h3>
  <p>Because every option counts, Uberify relies on the estimates Uber API to provide you with options to choose before calling an Uber. Just choose your ride and enjoy!</p>

  <h2>About the project</h2>
  <div>
  <p>This project was built during the Uber/Hackreactor hackathon. Uber worked closely with the Hack Reactor Remote Beta faculty, in a joint effort to expand developer outreach and help train engineers with our expertise in API development. Remote Beta’s real-time online program is available worldwide, and previous cohorts have attracted budding engineers from across the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong and Canada. The hackathon took place during the solo week of the HRRB7 cohort. You can read more about it <a href="https://devblog.uber.com/uber-and-hack-reactor-expand-outreach-to-aspiring-developers/">here</a></p>
